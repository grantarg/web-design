        <h2>My Favorite Website</h2>
            <p>I chose <span>Chief Delphi</span> to be the website that I analyzed for this Assignment. They have a dark colored website that is used to create a calming feeling while posting on the forum. I personally like the use of a grey tone as the main background color, and then use a darker color as the header for the page. This is similar to what I have done here, just with the darker color being on the outside of everything. For the text, they use an off white color listed below, which is very easy on the eyes, even with a dark background. Last of all, they have two more accent colors for login buttons and various other elements.</p>
        <h2>Hexadecimal Color Values</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>#222222</li>
                <li>#111111</li>
                <li>#14AEEA</li>
                <li>#FD8700</li>
                <li>#DDDDDD</li>
            </ul>
