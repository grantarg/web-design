            <p>In website design, responsive techniques are one of the most important principles, because it allows for your website to be viewed on a multitude of different devices. It can make your content accessible, easy to use on small screens, or more informative on a larger screen, such as a desktop or even TVs. Personally, I believe typical websites are not complete without a responsive layout.</p>
            <p>I found the article written by UXPin.com to be very informative on how to implement responsive design. One of their best practices is to pay attention to breakpoints, choosing to have only three: tablet, phone, and desktop. This was very important to me, considering I have used breakpoints in the past, and I could never decide how many to implement into my websites. With three clearly defined breakpoints, it should lead to a much more consistent, simple, and elegant website for the users to navigate. </p>
            <p>The next responsive design point that I found extremely helpful is to have the idea of minimizing and prioritizing your features for the mobile and even the desktop design to be very helpful. Considering that your website could have an endless amount of features, it's good to prioritize the very important ones, and streamline your user experiences. This way, you can save time, and not confuse anyone with features that really should not have been there in the first place.</p>
            <p>Another responsive design point that could be beneficial to implement into your design is a mobile-first design approach, meaning that your CSS and HTML will be built for the smallest size first, and then adapted for desktop size first. This way, the important features will be implemented first, and then you will be able to work on secondary features only applicable to the large desktop size.</p>
            <p>Finally, the last important design point in my opinion is to prioritize your content in ways that are meaningful to the purpose of your website. This allows the mobile users to only see the content that is crucial to them, and the desktop will see the content needed for desktop view.</p>
