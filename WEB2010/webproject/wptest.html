            <p>For my website project, I am building a website design business, so I believe that it is even more important to adhere to accessibility principles. This is because my potential clients will want their websites to also have these features too, so it is best to implement them within my business website to show them off. It is also crucial that there are no bugs in my website as well, because potential clients would not want to hire a web designer that has bugs in their own website.</p>
            <p>I first tested each page individually, checking for readability on different types of browsers, in order of popularity, and screen size as well. After almost every change to things such as CSS or HTML, I will check the scaling of the website to make sure it is still responsive. One bug I have now found is in the bottom about section of my website, and I plan to address it during the next week of development. I also ran my website through the Valiators provided by the textbook, which reported no issues.</p>
            <p>I then tested the accessibility of my website by viewing things such as larger zoom for people with bad eyesight, which did not affect the usability and HTML elements scaled as intended. I also tested my website with a plugin which disables images, and found that all images had text that would describe the image if it wasn’t able to be displayed. The only change I plan to make is to the main hero image, because it doesn’t have text that displays when the image can’t.</p>
